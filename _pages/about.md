Radu Varga started his musical journey at the age of 14, when he picked up an old guitar laying around the house in his hometown Reghin, Romania. As with many teenagers, at the beginning electric guitar and rock music was the main focus, but after having his first guitar lesson at 16 and being immediately fascinated with Classical Guitar, he started studying it intensely and has been regularly going to masterclasses with world renowned players and teachers.

Apart from Classical Music, in his youth he slowly but surely ventured more and more into improvised music, through genres such as Bossa Nova, Tangos, Jazz Standards, Soul, Pop - and has continued his musical training with lessons including Jazz Guitar and Funk Bass.

Since a few years he has been experimenting with beatmaking, looping and now electronic music is present in most of the music he does, with genres including Hip-Hop, Trap, Deep House, at the same time finding a passion for Middle Eastern and East European music, now studying Persian Santur and Turkish Ney - so today his music is a mixed bag of oriental themes, electronic beats and jazz ideas.

He is currently living in Leipzig.
