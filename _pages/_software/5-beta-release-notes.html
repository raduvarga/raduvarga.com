        <h2> Midi updates </h2>
        <ul class="description">
            <li> Implemented standard manual "Save" functionality for preset files, replacing the previous "autosave" functionality. The "Extra" mappings will still use "autosave" (which are globally saved in <i> extra.uax </i>). </li>
            <li> Plugin mappings are now saved per channel, so if a plugin is removed and reinserted later into any slot in the channel, the previous mappings will be loaded. </li>
            <li> Improved Midi Mapping process: After clicking "Start Mapping", clicking any button or moving a fader in Console will choose the appropriate parameter in the app, so you can now map like with a regular DAW: first move in Console, then move on your midi device. </li>
            <li> Automatically detect virtual ports and fix problems associated with them (like midi settings or mappings being forgotten at restart). Removed "Allow Virtual Midi Ports" setting. </li>
            <li> "Program Change" messages are now supported in Midi Mode. </li>
            <li> Added "Relative" button type. </li>
            <li> Added "Ref" level toggle for Line Inputs. </li>
            <li> Added "Channel Strip" to AUX channels. </li>
            <li> Added "Gain Reset" and "Volume Reset" to Preamp and Sends. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2> Mackie updates </h2>
        <ul class="description">
            <li> Combined Mackie and Midi Modes: It is now possible to create custom midi mappings with a device in Mackie Mode. </li>
            <li> Added "Mackie" section in Extra where special Mackie functions can be mapped. </li>
            <li> Added "DAW Mode" for Mackie (default is F1, or can be custom mapped in Extra/Macke). The app will create a virtual port for every Mackie device with the suffix "DAW", which you should use in your DAW instead of the original port. Then using the "DAW Mode" button, you can quickly switch your Mackie device between Console and your DAW.</li>
            <li> Added LED Feedback for Mackie navigation buttons. </li>
            <li> Fixed plugins being skipped in Mackie Mode. </li>
            <li> Fixed "Global Mappings" causing issues in Mackie Mode. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2> General updates </h2>
        <ul class="description">
            <li> Added "No Value" to Midi Output list. </li>
            <li> Fixed some rare random crashes that could occur. </li>
        </ul>
