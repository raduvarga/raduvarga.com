            <h3> Midi updates </h3>
            <ul class="description">
                <li> Implemented standard manual "Save" functionality (Cmd+S or File->Save) for preset files, replacing the previous "autosave" functionality. The "Extra" mappings will still use "autosave" (which are globally saved in <i> extra.uax </i>). </li>
                <li> Plugin mappings are now saved per channel, so if a plugin is removed and reinserted later into any slot in the channel, the previous mappings will be loaded. You will have to re-create the your plugin mappings for these changes to take effect. </li>
                <li> Improved Midi Mapping process: After pressing "Start Mapping", clicking any button or moving a fader in Console will choose the appropriate parameter in the app, so you can now map like in a regular DAW: first move in Console, then move on your midi device. </li>
                <li> Automatically detect virtual ports and fix problems associated with them (like midi settings or mappings being forgotten at restart). Removed "Allow Virtual Midi Ports" setting. </li>
                <li> "Program Change" messages are now supported in Midi Mode. </li>
                <li> Added "Relative" button type. </li>
                <li> Added "Ref" level toggle for Line Inputs. </li>
                <li> Added "Channel Strip" to AUX channels. </li>
                <li> Added "Hide Aux", "Hide Talkback" and "Hide Outputs" in Preferences->Console. </li>
                <li> Added "Gain Reset" and "Volume Reset" to Preamp and Sends. </li>
                <li> Allow the selection and removal of multiple parameter mappings in the UI. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3> Mackie updates </h3>
            <ul class="description">
                <li> Combined Mackie and Midi Modes: It is now possible to create custom midi mappings with devices in Mackie Mode. </li>
                <li> Added "Mackie" section in the "Extra" Channel, where special Mackie functions can be re-mapped. This allows smaller Mackie devices and also Eucon devices to re-map essential functions like Sends, Plugin, Fader Banks, etc. </li>
                <li> Added "DAW Mode" for Mackie (default is F1, or can be custom mapped in Extra->Mackie). The app will create a virtual port for every Mackie device with the suffix "DAW", which you should use in your DAW instead of the original port. Then using the "DAW Mode" button, you can quickly switch your Mackie device between Console and your DAW. The following DAWs are currently supported with DAW Mode: Logic, Ableton, FL Studio, Bitwig Studio.</li>
                <li> Added "Send 2" Assign to Mackie Mode, accesible by pressing the "Send" button twice. In this mode, the Select buttons will select the Send (first, second, etc.) and you will control that selected Send for each Channel.</li>
                <li> Added LED Feedback for Mackie navigation buttons. </li>
                <li> Fixed plugins being skipped in Mackie Mode. </li>
                <li> Fixed "Global Mappings" causing issues in Mackie Mode. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3> General updates </h3>
            <ul class="description">
                <li> Added "No Value" to Midi Output list. </li>
                <li> Fixed Window parameter not working correctly using toggle. Also added LED feedback to Window, which is limited to working only when the value is changed via midi (and not via mouse in Console). </li>
                <li> Fixed some rare random crashes that could occur. </li>
                <li> Migrated from the old discussion group to a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UaMidiControl/"> forum </a>. </li>
            </ul>
