At the moment I am receiving many requests for future enhancements. I am always working on improvements for the App, but given my current workload I cannot deliver as quickly as I may like to.

To speed up the development process, I've created separate fundraisers for a list of feature requested by users.

When any of the feature fundraiser goals have been fully reached, they will be prioritized, implemented and released as soon as possible. The estimated time is described separately for each. 
Partial funding will also be taken into consideration.

If you have any feature requests, don't hesitate to leave a comment below.
