Too see the complete list of feature requests or to submit a new one, click <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UaMidiControl/?f=flair_name%3A%22feature%20requests%22" target="_blank"> HERE </a>.

Based on the interest, I will include smaller features in upcoming updates.

For more complex requests, I've created separate fundraisers, which usually act as a pre-order for that feature.
When any of the feature fundraiser goals have been fully reached, they will be prioritized, implemented and released as soon as possible. Click on each fundraiser for more details.
